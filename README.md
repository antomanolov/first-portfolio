# Presentation of my first portfolio

This are a few little projects to show you my knowledge in Python, and codding in general.
## 1 The most used algorithms in programming
They still give me a hard time at times but I'm confident to get better with them.

## 2 Guessing game
This is a simple number guessing game. You choose the limits between which a number will be randomly selected and then, through the instructions of the "computer" to find the correct one.

## 3 Hangman game
Another simple game of a hangman. You have six attempts to guess the random word.

## 4 Web scraping project
This is a project that I am very proud of because I have never done anything like this before. 
The goal of the project is to download the first n albums from any given page and then save the data we decide we want to a database (in this case SQLlite3).

## 5 Pokemon battler - in construction/not finished
This will be a game in which you can battle with various types of pokemon, and use different types of moves. Every type of pokemon will have different set of moves.
